"How to make an vbscript" is the github for an video on youtube made by https://Youtube.com/@NorthYippee!
And like the title says, you learn on how to make an vbscript file!
Its easy if you copy and paste something over and over again and just change the text!
i got the message box with bard ai by google so you can ask ai too if something doesnt work!
im not judging if i did the same!
